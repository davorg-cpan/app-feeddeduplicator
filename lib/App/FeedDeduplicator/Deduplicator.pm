=head1 NAME

App::FeedDeduplicator::Deduplicator - Deduplicator class for App::FeedDeduplicator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is part of the App::FeedDeduplicator application. It is responsible for deduplicating entries from aggregated feeds.

It uses the LWP::UserAgent to fetch the feeds and HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath to parse the HTML content for canonical links.
The deduplication process is based on the entry's canonical link or title. The deduplicated entries are stored in a list for further processing.
It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Aggregator and Publisher classes to provide a complete feed deduplication and publishing solution.
It is part of a larger application that aggregates, deduplicates, and publishes feeds.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::FeedDeduplicator::Deduplicator;

    my $deduplicator = App::FeedDeduplicator::Deduplicator->new(
        entries => $aggregated_entries,
        ua      => LWP::UserAgent->new(),
    );

    $deduplicator->deduplicate();

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new instance of App::FeedDeduplicator::Deduplicator. The constructor accepts a list of entries and a user agent as parameters.
The entries should be an array reference containing hash references with the keys 'entry' and 'feed'.
The 'entry' key should contain an XML::Feed::Entry object, and the 'feed' key should contain a hash reference with the feed information.
The user agent should be an instance of LWP::UserAgent.

=head2 deduplicate

The main method that deduplicates entries from the aggregated feeds. It iterates through the entries and checks for duplicates based on the canonical link or title.
It uses a hash to keep track of seen entries and filters out duplicates. The deduplicated entries are stored in the $deduplicated attribute.
It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Aggregator and Publisher classes to provide a complete feed deduplication and publishing solution.

=head2 find_canonical

Finds the canonical link for a given entry. It fetches the entry's link using LWP::UserAgent and parses the HTML content using HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath.
It looks for the <link rel="canonical"> tag in the HTML content and returns the canonical URL if found. If the canonical link is not found, it returns undef.
It is used during the deduplication process to determine the unique identifier for each entry.
